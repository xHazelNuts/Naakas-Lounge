#List users here to be made admins with the format: ckey = rank name.
#Ckey will be converted to ckey format, lowercase with no punctuation except '@'.
#Rank name will match anything after ' = ' and has not format requirements.
#Ranks will match to those with the same name in admin_ranks.txt, if a match isn't found the user won't be adminned.
#If SQL-based admin loading is enabled, admins listed here will always be loaded first and will override any duplicate entries in the database.
